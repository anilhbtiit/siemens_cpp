/*

Cache Line Size:
The cache line is the smallest unit of data loaded from memory into the CPU cache.
Modern processors typically have cache lines of 64 bytes (but this can vary).
When data is accessed, the entire cache line containing that data is loaded into the cache.
Why Alignment Matters:
When a variable or data structure is aligned to the cache line boundary, it improves cache utilization and minimizes cache misses.
Cache misses occur when the CPU needs to fetch data from main memory because itâ€™s not in the cache.
Unaligned data can span multiple cache lines, leading to extra cache misses and wasted memory.

//On a 32-bit processor, the aligned version would look like this:

//| c | padding | i | s |

//If the struct were packed (e.g., from network transmission), it might be unaligned
//| c | i | s |
