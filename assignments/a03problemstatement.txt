Questions on Template

0. go thru the programs written in day3_29_05\a02template

1.  (Operator Overloads in Templates) Write a simple
function template for predicate function isEqualTo that
compares its two arguments of the same type with the equality
operator ( == ) and returns true if they are equal and false
otherwise. Use this function template in a program that calls
isEqualTo only with a variety of fundamental types. Now write a
separate version of the program that calls isEqualTo with a
user-defined class type, but does not overload the equality
operator. What happens when you attempt to run this program?
Now overload the equality operator (with the operator function)
operator== . Now what happens when you attempt to run this



2. open the code 
https://github.com/cusplibrary/cusplibrary/tree/main/examples/Algorithms
and see are you able to understand the syntax.
https://github.com/cusplibrary/cusplibrary/tree/main/cusp/detail
open the header files and see are you able to understand the syntax.


3. create a template array where [] operator is overloaded to add an element into the array and 
and get(index) function should return the element from the array.


----------------------------------------------------------

04. open the code and understand the
a09_variadictemplate.cpp

05). write a template function which will return the uppercase
of a string if template parameter is of type string and 
return double of a numeric type in case parameter of the template is
a numeric type.

06). write a templatized calculator which can take only all category of numeric types and
 float types. 
add(2,3).. it should be able to sum it up.  9
multiply (2,3)  , it should able to to 24
subtract (2,3) , it should give the correct answers.

07). ensure you save the copy of the calculator program and make it take any number 
of arguments.
add(2,3,4,5)
multiply(4,6)
subtract(4,7,1)

08).06 th example,  ensure you move the template code into a header file. header implementation
and ensure it works only for int and double make a static library of implementation


and write a separate cpp with main to prove it works.


------------------------------------------------------

09)
look at examples in day2_27_05\a01constexpr code samples.

in the calculator program, think where all you can use constexpr.
and use it and see whether it works.

Questions on auto.

go thru the files present in  day2_27_05\a02auto folder

10).
Declare a variable using auto and initialize it with an
 integer value.
Declare another variable using auto and initialize it with
 a floating-point value.
Print both variables to verify that their types 
were correctly inferred.

11).
Create an array of Devices where 
deviceid int ,name string, location string  and
 status is bool.
Use a range-based for loop with auto to iterate over the
 elements of the array.
Print each element.


12)
Write a function that takes two integers as input and returns
 their sum.
Use auto as the return type for this function.
Call the function and print the result.

13).
Write code that creates a reference to a variable and
uses auto to deduce the reference type.
prove the difference  between auto and auto&.


14).
Write code that creates a pointer to a variable and
uses auto to deduce the pointer type.
Explore the difference between auto* and auto with a
pointer literal.

   /*

#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int value = 42;

  // auto deduces a reference type (int&)
  auto ref = value;

  // auto& directly creates a reference
  auto& ref2 = value;

  std::cout << "Type of ref: " << typeid(ref).name() << std::endl;
  std::cout << "Type of ref2: " << typeid(ref2).name() << std::endl;

  // Modifying through ref modifies the original value
  ref = 100;
  std::cout << "value after modifying ref: " << value << std::endl;

  // Modifying through ref2 modifies the original value (same as ref)
  ref2 = 200;
  std::cout << "value after modifying ref2: " << value << std::endl;

  return 0;
}


#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int value = 42;

  // auto deduces a pointer type (int*)
  auto ptr = &value;

  // auto with a pointer literal creates an int* (not a reference)
  auto ptr2 = new int(100); // Dynamically allocated memory

  std::cout << "Type of ptr: " << typeid(ptr).name() << std::endl;
  std::cout << "Type of ptr2: " << typeid(ptr2).name() << std::endl;

  // Modifying through ptr modifies the original value
  *ptr = 200;
  std::cout << "value after modifying through ptr: " << value << std::endl;

  // Modifying through ptr2 modifies the allocated memory (not value)
  *ptr2 = 300;
  std::cout << "*ptr2 after modification: " << *ptr2 << std::endl;
  std::cout << "value after modifying ptr2 (not affected): " << value << std::endl;

  // Remember to deallocate memory using delete
  delete ptr2;

  return 0;
}

auto ptr = &value;
auto deduces the type of the address-of operator (&value) which is a pointer to int (int*). This points to the memory location of value.
auto ptr2 = new int(100);
auto with a new expression creates a pointer to the
 allocated memory. Here, it allocates memory for an int
  with the value 100 and ptr2 becomes a pointer to that
   memory (int*). 
   
   It's important to note that this creates a new variable in
    memory, not a reference to value.

look at 

look at examples in look at 
day5_03_06\a01constexpr for syntax 

15) create a class called Rectangle with length,breadth and funtions for getting
area and perimeter using const expressions. look at 

16) look at the code base and see are they using any examples for constexpr.

17) try to create a vector with device objects where device means int deviceid, bool status and std::string devicename.
and iterate by auto and iterate by using the iterator and meaasure how much time it takes.

19) create a program which does the following which has deviceobject which contains deviceid, bool status
and devicename. have a constructor which takes all the 3 arguments and intializes them.

have a menu as follows.
X menu
1. create device object.
0. exit

when 0 is selected we should come out of main.
when 1 is selected show a submenu as follows.

Y menu
1. create device with new.
2. create device with unique_ptr
3. create device with shared_ptr.
0. return

when user selects 0. ensure you get back to the X Menu.
when 1 is selected ensure you allocate memory by using new.
when 2 is selected ensure you allocate memory by unique_ptr
when 3 is selected ensure you allocate memory by using shared_ptr.

---------------------------------------------------------------

20. create an array filled with 10000 random numbers.
 and create two threads.
one should count the number of odd numbers in the array and print it
and second one should count the number of even numbers in the array
 and print it.

 main()
    array of 10000 numbers filled with random numbers.
    t1  --array
    t2  --array 


2. modify the same program where the threads should return the number of odd numbers
and even numbers to the main function and we should print it there.


3. look at a02problemstatement.txt and see whether we can use any threads in that scenario.

4. look in the code base for thread usage and constexpr usage and see where all it is being used.

5. look in the code base for automic usage and see with what datatypes they are using.

6. copy paste some examples on automic and see if you dont use automic what is consequence..

7. look in the code base whether mutex or semaphore has been used in the code if yes why..
